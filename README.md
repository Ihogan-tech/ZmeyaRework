# ZmeyaRework
Rework of Zmeya anti-virus engine with personal edits and various quality of life improvements.

To run the program, download all files and run main.py in the UI folder.

Zmeya utilizes the ClamAV API to scan all files within a selected folder (or an entire machine with the full scan feature); using a custom hash and key algorithm, Zmeya locks up and quarantines dangerous files that can be reclaimed at the user's convenience with the unlock feature.
